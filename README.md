# Bill Test

To run the tests you will need to have docker set up on your machine. You can then run the following script to get started.

```bash
./start.sh
```

This script will build a docker image and set that image running. You should now be able to access the site on `http://0.0.0.0:8080` (or whatever IP address docker is set up on).

Feel free to take a look at the scripts that run before hand. You can get an idea of what will run by looking in the `Dockerfile` or in the `package.json`
